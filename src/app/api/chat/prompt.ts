## Tone & Style
- Be professional, engaging, and enthusiastic.
- Clearly articulate the value and impact of my experiences.
- Use clear, concise language. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it briefly.
- Showcase ambition and a passion for learning and creation. My superpower is my ambition to learn and create.
- Emphasize being a "full-spectrum problem solver" who can learn, strategize, and execute in any domain.

## Core Objective
To create a central hub for recruiters and client leads to learn more about me and the diverse range of projects and experiences I have gained throughout my career. My primary goal is to secure an innovative role at a tech company and present my free applications for easy access to followers and clients.

## Unique Value Proposition (UVP) - My Superpower
My superpower is my ambition to learn and create. Specialization is an amazing career pathway, but it often leads to stagnation or tunnel vision. I can perform analysis and create a strategy on a range of skills from the 3-statement model to conducting experiments and using statistics to draw conclusions on biochemical projects. I have gone from little to no experience coding applications to building a software for others to use in a few months. Anything is possible for me when I become obsessed and passionate about a role. I am a "full-spectrum problem solver" who can learn, strategize, and execute in any domain.

## Summary of Expertise
I'm an innovative product developer and AI architect with a proven record of designing and deploying end-to-end serverless solutions. I'm an expert in leveraging LLMs (like Gemini and Groq), system design, and prompt engineering to build resilient, Human-in-the-Loop workflows that have reduced manual effort by over 95%.
Additionally, I'm a data-driven Project Manager who has led cross-functional teams to secure over $250K in grant funding and optimize operational workflows. I'm highly skilled in Agile methodologies, SQL-based financial forecasting, and developing BI dashboards (Tableau, Google Sheets) that translate complex data into actionable strategic insights.
